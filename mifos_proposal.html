<h2 id="21-migration-from-mvp-to-mvvm">2.1 Migration from MVP to MVVM</h2>
<p>The MVVM architecture is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. Configuration changes such as screen rotations are handled properly by ViewModels.It separates the responsibilities of the user interface from the business logic, which makes the code easier to maintain and test.Because the ViewModel is decoupled from the View, it can be unit tested without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). This makes testing faster and more reliable.MVVM leverages data binding to establish a connection between the View and ViewModel. This means that changes made to the ViewModel are automatically reflected in the View, and vice versa. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to keep the UI up-to-date.Because the ViewModel contains the business logic, changes to the UI can be made without affecting the underlying data or business logic. This makes it easier to maintain and extend the code over time.</p>
<h3 id="211-migrating-an-activity">2.1.1 Migrating an Activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the original code, all the business logic was in the SplashActivity class. This violates the separation of concerns principle, which states that each class should have a single responsibility. In the MVVM architecture, the ViewModel is responsible for holding the data and the business logic, while the View (in this case, the SplashActivity) is responsible for displaying the data and handling user interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, to follow this principle, we create a separate SplashViewModel class that holds the business logic, and move the logic from the SplashActivity to the SplashViewModel. This way, the SplashActivity is only responsible for displaying the data returned by the SplashViewModel, and the SplashViewModel is responsible for deciding what data to return and how to generate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SplashViewModelFactory is used to create an instance of the SplashViewModel. We use a Factory instead of directly creating a new instance of the ViewModel class because the ViewModel class has a lifecycle that is tied to the lifecycle of the View (i.e., the SplashActivity), and the Factory ensures that we always get the same instance of the ViewModel even if the View is recreated due to configuration changes like screen rotation. The Factory creates the ViewModel using the PasscodePreferencesHelper object as a constructor parameter, so that the ViewModel has access to the data it needs to generate the appropriate Intent.
Below is the code for SplashViewModel.kt</p>
</li>

<h3 id="212-migrating-a-fragment">2.1.2 Migrating a fragment</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have converted the LocationsFragment from MVP to MVVM because the MVVM pattern separates the business logic from the view, making the code more modular and easier to test.In the MVP pattern, the presenter is responsible for handling the business logic and updating the view, which can lead to tight coupling between the view and the presenter. This can make the code harder to maintain and test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the MVVM pattern, the view model is responsible for handling the business logic, while the view is responsible for displaying the data. This separation of concerns makes the code more modular and easier to test.To convert the LocationsFragment from MVP to MVVM, I removed any reference to the presenter and created a view model to handle the business logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the LocationsViewModel class, I created two methods to handle the logic previously handled by the presenter. These methods receive the GoogleMap instance as a parameter and use it to add a marker and animate the camera to the headquarter location. In the LocationsFragment, I removed the onCreateView() method from the MVP implementation and created a viewModel property that is initialized in the onCreateView() method. I also removed the addMarker() and addAnimationToHeadquarter() methods and called the corresponding methods in the viewModel instance from the onMapReady() method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, the MVVM implementation is more modular and easier to test, as the business logic is separated from the view.<br>
Below is the LocationsViewModel.kt :</p>

<h2 id="22-basic-integration-of-navigation-graph">2.2 Basic Integration of Navigation Graph</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Navigation Component in Android provides a framework for implementing navigation between screens in an application. It uses a Navigation Graph, which is an XML file that defines the navigation paths and destinations in an app.The first step in integrating the Navigation Graph is to create the graph file and define the navigation paths and destinations. This can be done using Android Studio's Navigation Editor, which provides a visual interface for designing the graph.</li>
<li>Once the Navigation Graph is created, the next step is to integrate it into the app's code. This involves using the Navigation Component APIs to load and navigate to the appropriate destination based on user input.</li>
<li>As an example , I have taken up SettingsFragment and UpdatePasswordFragment . To implement a navigation graph I have added these two files in the xml and defined an action from SettingsFragment to the UpdatePasswordFragment.Having done this, I added a <strong>FragmentContainerView</strong> in the SettingsActivity that will act as my NavHost. <br><br><br></li>
<li>The appropriate changes in <code>activity_settings.xml</code> is :</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Now we do not need <code>replaceFragment(SettingsFragment.newInstance(), false,R.id.fragmentContainerView)</code> in the SettingsActivity.We now just need to do one last change in the SettingsFragment i.e. we need to add findNavController.</li>
<li>The change in the SettingsFragment is :</li>
</ul>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>override fun onPreferenceTreeClick(preference: Preference): Boolean {
        when (preference.key) {
            Constants.PASSWORD -&gt; findNavController().navigate(R.id.action_settingsFragment_to_updatePasswordFragment)
        }
        return super.onPreferenceTreeClick(preference)
    }
</div></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>I have taken this just to show it as demo and I can add a few more navigation graphs that would make the app further scalable. For instance , currently we have a <strong>LoginActivity</strong> and a <strong>RegisterationActivity</strong> .But the role of the <strong>RegisterationActivity</strong> is just to replace the fragment which is <strong>RegisterationFragment</strong>. We can get rid of the two activities and replace them by just one activity let's say <strong>AuthenticationActivity</strong> and convert the <strong>LoginActivity</strong> to a fragment.</li>
<li>So now you will have just one Activity and on top of that you will have two fragments that can be added in another navigation graph.

</ul>
<h1 id="23-migration-from-dagger-to-hilt">2.3 Migration from Dagger to Hilt</h1>
<ul>
<li>I will undertake the task of migrating from dagger to hilt</li>
<li>Hilt uses annotation processing to generate code at compile time, which can improve performance compared to Dagger's runtime reflection</li>
<li>We will start off with a <code>@Singleton</code> component and then later migrate activities and fragments</li>
<li>I propose we migrate the Login and Registeration first and then move towards nested fragments and during the migration I'll remove all  <code>@Component</code> and <code>@Subcomponent</code> interfaces and annotate all modules with <code>@InstallIn</code>.</li>
<li>After the migration, all Application/Activity/Fragment/View classes will be annotated with <code>@AndroidEntryPoint</code> and any code instantiating or propagating components shall be removed.
<br></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="24-basic-integration-of-coroutines">2.4 Basic integration of coroutines</h1>
<ul>
<li>Coroutines are particularly effective for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading from a file, making a network request, or accessing a database. By using coroutines for these tasks, we can avoid blocking the main thread of our application and keep it responsive</li>
<li>By using coroutines for these tasks, we can ensure that the application remains responsive and doesn't freeze up

<li>A probable approach of implementing rocket chat would include :
<ul>
<li>Saving client id and client secret in the app</li>
<li>Request access to user data from the app.</li>
<li>Use the authorization code to get the access token.</li>
<li>Use the access token to interact with the API.</li>

<ul>
<li>Currently the workflows do not have any jobs that runs the Unit tests or the UI tests. Hence modifications in the workflow to allow both tests to run will be a good feature to have.By running unit tests and UI tests as part of our Github workflow, we can get early feedback on code changes and catch issues before they are merged into the main branch. This can help prevent bugs from being introduced into the production code.</li>
<li>It can provide a faster feedback loop for developers and can help them iterate and develop features more quickly.By automating testing as part of your Github workflow, you can reduce the need for manual testing. This can save time and resources and allow developers to focus on other tasks.</li>

<h2 id="27-my-ideas-for-the-app">2.7 My Ideas for the app</h2>
<p>There are certain features that are not currently present in the ideas list but in my opinion would look good and also be in accordance with the new android standards.</p>
<h3 id="271-migrating-from-butter-knife-to-view-binding">2.7.1 Migrating from Butter Knife to View Binding</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As the Android Development scene continues to grow, new build tools are created in order to address issues developers had seen using previous solutions. A commonly used tool was Butterknife. At the time, Butterknife was used to reduce the the amount of times the findViewById(...) function had been used in order to reference a view in your application. However, Butterknife still had its own issues such as null safety and speed. Now introduce View Binding: a low code, null safe, and fast binding tool! View Binding is a 1st party tool built by the Google Android Development team which helps reference and easily manage views within an app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butterknife is a 3rd party library made to address the issue of using findViewById(...) functions to reference and interact with views. It helped reduce boilerplate code but also had to set up a @Bind annotation every time you wanted to interact with a view. Then View Binding was introduced starting at Gradle version 3.6.This single binding variable allows us to access every view, set up event listeners, and any other functionality we'd do with Butterknife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On top of Butterknife being deprecated, another reason to switch is because View Binding is compile time safe and builds fast. As for findViewById(...), this way of referencing views will lead to so much unnecessary code that could be replaced with a View Binding variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First step would be to upgrade the gradle version to 7.3.1 from 7.2.0 and then adding the dependency as:</p>
<ul>
<li>android {
...
buildFeatures {
viewBinding = true
}
} <br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For demonstration , I have migrated the LoginActivity from <strong>Butter Knife</strong> to <strong>View Binding</strong>. The modified file can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/PratyushSingh07/9c005a4c8ac8ff127550912f658a53d0">here</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar approach could be applied on the fragments as well .</p>
<h3 id="272-adding-option-to-change-connection-setting-from-login-page">2.7.2 Adding Option to Change Connection setting from login page</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently the when you go to <strong>Settings</strong> and then click on <strong>Update Endpoint</strong> and try to change the endpoint they user is sent back to the LoginActivity. And now the user cannot log in back because of the updated endpoint which might be incorrect.The user would then have to uninstall the app and then install it again just to gain access of the system</li>
<li>To overcome this there should be a support in the LoginActivity to change the <strong>Connection Settings</strong> that would allow the user to change the endpoint without having to uninstall the app. This would save the users time and would be a good feature to have</li>
<li>The implementation idea can be derived from <strong>Android Client</strong> that presently has this feature and the same can be replicated over in mifos mobile. <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90026952/224733546-0cc1c646-fa88-4fa6-9de3-571737fb050d.mp4">Here</a> is a video for your reference
<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="273-introduce-animations-for-smooth-transition">2.7.3 Introduce animations for smooth transition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently there are no animations in place when we switch between screens</li>
<li>For instance , animations can be introduced while entering a new screen and when leaving a screen</li>
<li>I have added some animations whose xml can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/PratyushSingh07/f5dde80701be455e171c82e34db745e0">here</a></li>
<li>If implemented they will provide a smooth transition when switching between different screens</li>

<ul>
<li>Get in touch with the developers and the mentor</li>
<li>Introduction to the community, to the mentor and fix timings to communicate</li>
<li>Discuss any suggestions and changes to the project. There could modifications, new additions or ammendments; it would be better to go over these early</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="week-2">Week 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go Thorugh Mifos-Mobile codebase</li>
<li>Take reference from android client and try to implement features that are currently absent in mifos-mobile</li>
<li>Go through the Open Banking API and related documentations</li>

<h3 id="week-3">Week 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the working of the existing application with the mentor. Discuss the implementations of the new features</li>
<li>Go over the new design in detail and ask for changes and suggestions</li>

<h3 id="week-4">Week 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will start off gradually with the migration from MVP to MVVM architectural style</li>
<li>The order that I will follow is :
<ul>
<li>Splash Activity</li>
<li>Login Activity</li>
<li>Registeration Fragment</li>
<li>PassCode Activity</li>
<li>HomeOld Fragment</li>
<li>Home Fragment and so on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This order is somewhat sequential and will be one of the first steps to be undertaken</li>
<li>I would also take inputs from my mentors and if the need arises, change the order of the migration</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="week-5">Week 5</h3>
<ul>
<li>I would dedicate this week to the implementation of the Navigation graph</li>
<li>I would start off by grouping the fragments that are connected in a sequential flow and map out a graph for the same in the xml</li>
<li>This would require the addition of FragmentContainerView in certain activities which will allow further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView and providing a consistent timing for lifecycle events.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="week-6">Week 6</h3>
<ul>
<li>This week would be reserved for the migration from dagger to hilt &amp; also for the integration of coroutines in the project</li>
<li>Considering the fact that we need to write unit tests as well, Hilt will make it easier to write unit tests for the code by allowing us to easily swap out dependencies with mock objects</li>
<li>Hence it will be better to get on with this at the earliest so that we can lay foundation for a better unit test phase</li>

<ul>
<li>replace existing api layer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="week-12">Week 12</h3>
<ul>
<li>I shall be writing unit tests for the data layer in this week of GSoC</li>
<li>Uptill here we would have migrated a certain portion of our project to MVVM and hence the tests can now be written keeping the new architecture in mind</li>
<li>I shall be using Mockito framework to write the tests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="week-13">Week 13</h3>
<ul>
<li>This week will be dedicated to performing the UI tests using espresso whose dependencies are already present in the gradle</li>
<li>We will have decent amount of changes to the UI uptill here and hence tests that cover all the screens must be put in place</li>
<li>This will ensure that the views are displayed correctly and look the way they're supposed to.Besides it will ensure that the interactions are handled correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="week-14">Week 14</h3>
<ul>
<li>After writing all the unit tests I will add appropriate jobs in the existing workflow to run these tests</li>

<p>As an android developer my first and foremost goal is to master the Android SDK,Multithreading and other related technologies and create a portfolio of projects that would include personal projects, open source contributions, or projects done as part of my studies or work.
As I gain more experience , I would want to specialize in UI/UX design along with enterprise app development and seek out for leadership roles.
I would sooner or later venture into AOSP and get a grasp of low level android as well and transition into a full stack mobile developer.
I am self taught like many other developers out there and Open Source Projects have played an integral part in my growth and thus I would give back to this android community by sharing my knowledge and expertise through blog posts, tutorials,speaking engagements and ofcourse by contributing to Open Source Projects.
